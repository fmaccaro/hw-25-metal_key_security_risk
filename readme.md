The proposed project consists of a comprehensive security analysis concerning the use of metal keys as physical access control mechanisms in high-security environments. 
Its primary objective is to enhance awareness of the security risks inherent in the reliance on such a widely deployed tool. 
To support broad dissemination, the final results will be made publicly available in a document designed for easy download and printing, thereby facilitating its distribution and practical adoption.
